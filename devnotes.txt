TODO:


-allow the user to input workouts (first create default ones to be the placeholders) which will be stored in the user 
 models and then will populate the routine calendar 'landing zone'

-Implement logic so that when the user drags exercise elements into the routine calender 'day' cells the state of that 
 schedule is saved across the board, until the user updates it or 'resets' the calendar using a button (implement as well)

-allow users to shift between graphs
 (records : [week, month, year view], routine: week, custom view (user may input as many 'day' cells as they want up to 10))

-track date and time and sync with time that user inputs stats

-Implement registration & login authentication 
 (upon first login and initial registration require email authentication, already works with sendgrid via the forgot 
  password system)

-Implement challenge objects and rotation && user completion logic
-Implement friend system
-Implement notifications
-Implement Privacy Settings
-Implement direct message system between friends
-Implement group message system
-Implement find friend, group, and view global point leader and timeline in HOME

FIXME:
-Input Stat screen redesign
-Fix Change Password using allauth (from profile settings)
-Rework user workout stats and table 
-Rework leaderboard functionality with points
